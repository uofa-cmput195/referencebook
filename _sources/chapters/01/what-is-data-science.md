What is Data Science?
====================

Data science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data sets through exploration, prediction, and inference. It integrates techniques from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze and interpret complex data sets. There are three core aspects of effective data analysis:


* Exploration: Identifying patterns in information. This involves using visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the data.
* Prediction: Using existing information to make informed guesses about unknown values. This involves machine learning and optimization techniques.
* Inference: Quantifying our degree of certainty. This involves determining whether patterns found in data will also appear in new observations and assessing the accuracy of predictions using statistical tests and models.


Statistics is a central component of data science because statistics studies how to make robust conclusions based on incomplete information. Computing is a central component because programming allows us to apply analysis techniques to the large and diverse data sets that arise in real-world
applications: not just numbers, but text, images, videos, and sensor readings. Data science is all of these things, but it is more than the sum of its parts because of the applications. Through understanding a particular domain, data scientists learn to ask appropriate questions about their data and correctly interpret the answers provided by our inferential and computational tools.
