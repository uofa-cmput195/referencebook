Computational Tools
===================

This text uses the Python 3 programming language, along with a standard set of
numerical and data visualization tools that are used widely in commercial
applications, scientific experiments, and open-source projects.
Python has recruited enthusiasts from many professions that use data to draw
conclusions. We will explore the most common libraries used by data scientists community.

**Getting Started.** The easiest way to write Python programs without installing the dependancies is to use Jupyter Notebook with Google Colab. You don't have to install any data science libraries to use them. If you use @ualberta.ca email to login to Google Colab and use Jupyter Notebook within cloud environment.

You are not at all restricted to using this web-based programming environment. If you wish to run your program locally you can do so by installing the libraries we will use throughout the course.
